♿ AccessPrep
AI-Powered Interview Coach for Disabled & Anxious Candidates

AccessPrep is an AI-powered interview preparation platform built to support people with disabilities and interview anxiety. The system delivers adaptive, bias-free mock interviews that change interview format, interaction style, and evaluation logic based on individual accessibility needs. The goal is to provide realistic interview practice while ensuring fairness, comfort, and confidence-building.

🎯 Why AccessPrep?

Traditional interview platforms assume all candidates can speak fluently, hear clearly, see standard interfaces, and perform under pressure. This creates an unfair disadvantage for disabled and anxious candidates. AccessPrep solves this problem by designing mock interviews that adapt to the candidate, not the other way around.

🔥 Core Features
Adaptive AI Mock Interviews

The platform conducts realistic mock interviews where the AI interviewer dynamically adjusts question delivery, pacing, and follow-ups. Candidates can respond via text, speech, or hybrid modes without penalty. The interviewer behavior adapts based on disability type and anxiety level.

Bias-Free Interview Evaluation

Answers are evaluated based on clarity of ideas, logic, and relevance, not speech speed, pronunciation, pauses, or physical delivery. This ensures fair assessment for candidates with speech or communication challenges.

Resume-Based Interview Simulation

AccessPrep generates interview questions directly from the user’s resume and selected job role. This creates personalized mock interviews that closely match real hiring scenarios.

Follow-Up Question Intelligence

The AI asks contextual follow-up questions based on user responses, simulating real interviewer thinking rather than fixed question lists.

Anxiety-Aware Interview Mode

The system provides a calm interview environment with optional timers, gentle interviewer tone, pause-and-resume support, and gradual difficulty increase. Anxiety is treated as an accessibility requirement, not a weakness.

Structured Answer Coaching

Candidates receive optional answer guidance using structured frameworks (such as STAR) to help organize responses clearly under pressure.

AI Interview Mentor (Advanced)

A personal AI mentor explains feedback, tracks long-term progress, identifies recurring issues, and builds personalized improvement plans across sessions.
